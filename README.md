README:

This program outputs two lists of numbers via two separate text files: one for the 40-year progression of wealth for a financially literate person, and another for that of a financially illiterate person.

To run the program, type the following commands into the terminal once you've navigated to the correct directory:

		gcc -o ./hello FinancialSimulation.c

		./hello

Once those have are executed, two text files will be generated containing the wealth arrays described at the top of this text file.
